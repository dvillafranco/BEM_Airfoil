THIS FILE IS USED AFTER a BEM.1***.in file is run.
It starts from the steady lift solution and proceeds
on with the unsteady lift calculation.


INPUT FIELDS:
============
Geompath  (not that necessary because data will come 
		from steady run case)
DoField, DoVort, Fixed_Wake, Steady, WriteDatFile 
	(will always have Steady set to False)
	(Do Vort set to true as above requires that 
		the input file Vort.1***.in exists)
	(Other variables are the same as in BEM.1***.in)
Mach,      dn,    delta,     AOA	
	(Really only running for Mach number of 0.0)
	(Other variables are the same!)
Tf,        Nt
	(Tf and Nt are set by the specs of the problem you
		are simulating. See below for more details) 
TEcond,    BCmode,   BCfreq
	(We have found that the trailing edge condition 1
		as implemented in the code gives the best
		unsteady results -- this is different than
		the steady case where condition 0 is used
	For the BCmode options see BEM.1example.in. For
		a passing vortex use BCmode 1 plus DoVort = T)
Npieces
	(This doesn't matter in the BEM.2***.in file, information
		is read in from the BEM.1***.in run)
Case name of output from steady run
	(If BEM.1example.in was run first then the name here 
		is   1example )
?????


****************

NOTES on TF and NT:
For an unsteady passing vortex run, dt = TF/NT.  Tf should be 
about 2 times the distance of the vortex's initial x location
from the center of the airfoil.  This ensures that the vortex will
travel approximately the same distance downstream so its path is
compatible on both sides of the midchord. This is necessary for
the transform to be calculated correctly.
