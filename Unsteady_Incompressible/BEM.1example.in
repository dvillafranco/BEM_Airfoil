INPUT FIELDS:
============
Geompath:  name of directory where data file would be stored
		(if not using NACA airfoil)
DoField, DoVort, Fixed_Wake, Steady, WriteDatFile
Mach,      dn,    delta,     AOA
Tf,        Nt
TEcond,    BCmode,   BCfreq
Npieces
AFtype     Nx        spacing
trans(2)   scales(2)


NOTES: 
-- DoField computes far field as well as near field
-- DoVort allows for imposed upstream vortex filament
-- Fixed_Wake allows for free wake calculation
-- Steady allows from unsteady calculation
-- WriteDatFile , was really used when debugging -- adds a lot
	of output files.

-- Mach number -- only valid to use with 0 at this point
 
--- dn is important for compressible flow calculations. This
two-dimensional version does not have compressibility added to it.A

--- delta is the regularization parameter for the free wake evolution

-- Tf is the length of the wake and Nt is the number of chunks in 
the wake (i.e. number of time steps).  For steady runs, make the
length of the wake very long and  use a moderate number of chunks.
This pushes the starting vortex very far away.  You can look at
the lift data to make sure that it has been run for enough time
steps so that the lift levels off.

--Nt is calculated  directly from Tf and dt. Dt is known based on
the Nyquist criterion. If you want to resolve frequencies up
to F, then dt = 1/2f, and Nt = Tf/dt.

-- TEcond allows for different method of imposin the Kutta Condition.
	For steady flow use 1

-- BC mode  allows for Sears input, Theodorsen input, etc.  
	    case (1) ! Steady freestream in \hat i direction

-- BC freq - if BC mode used, must input nondimensional frequency 
	as well (nondim by ????)

-- Npieces -- 1 for single element wing. >1 if have slats/flaps

-- Aftype:  Can simply specify  "NACA 0001"   or can give it a 
	file name with the data.  

-- Nx : Number of panels on the airfoil (top and bottom together)

-- spacing : linear, mixed, cosine.   Use when using NACA airfoils.
	when supplying your own data, the spacing in the data
	file is used. 

--  Trans:  if you want to move the airfoil in translation , enter how 
	many units  (or just put 0 0 ).
 
-- Scales:  ifyou want to scale the airfoil in the streamwise and other
	direction put in values not equal to 1 here.
