The Example in this directory:

Running the code as described in DOC/run.the.program with these 
input files (*.mstream is not used), generates the *.bin files
in this directory.

These files can be read into Matlab as is using the BEM2d_readbin.m
program.  Also described in DOC/run.the.program

The geometry is a joukowski airfoil at an AOA and a simulation of a vortex
passing the airfoil was completed. The steady state condition was
obtained first followed by the response to the passing vortex.
